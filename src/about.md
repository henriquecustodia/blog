Hey, nice to see you here! 

I'm a front-end developer that loves to study new things. 
It's very common to find me spending free time studying a new technology or concept. 
I do like to go beyond my comfort zone.

For most of the projects in my career, I dealt with Angular. I achieved a lot of knowledge in this framework and its advanced patterns.  

Here, I'll share all the things I learned all these years.
 
Hope you enjoy it!
