Hey, nice to see you here! 

Well, I'm a frontend deloper that love study new things. 
It's very common find me spending weekends to study a new technology or concept. 

Most of time in my career I've worked with Angular - That's a really nice framework. 

Here, I'll share all the things I've learned for all these years.

Hope you enjoy!
