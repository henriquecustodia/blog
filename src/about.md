Hey, nice to see you here! 

Well, I'm a frontend developer that love study new things. 
It's very common find me spending free time to study a new technology or concept. 
I really like to go beyond from my confort zone.

Most of projects I've worked, I've dealt with Angular - That's a really nice framework, 
and I've achieved a lot of knowledge in advanced frontend patterns.  

Here, I'll share all the things I've learned for all these years.

Hope you enjoy!
